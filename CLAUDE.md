working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

**hf-gps-tec** is a Python client for the HamSCI (Ham Radio
Science Citizen Investigation) sigmond suite that mimics the receive
sites of the high-frequency (HF) PRN-coded beacon network described
by Hysell et al. (2018, *JGR Space Physics* 123:6851–6864) and
Aricoche & Hysell (2024, *JGR ML&C* 1).  It subscribes to per-frequency
I/Q multicast streams from `radiod` via `ka9q-python`, correlates each
frame against a bank of pseudorandom-noise replicas, and produces
JSON-Lines (JSONL) per-minute records of pseudorange, Doppler shift,
and amplitude for each (transmitter, receiver, frequency) link.

Part of the HamSCI sigmond suite — see
`/opt/git/sigmond/sigmond/CLAUDE.md` (orchestrator) and
`/opt/git/sigmond/CLAUDE.md` (umbrella) for cross-repo context.
Follows the same Pattern A install layout and contract surface as
`psk-recorder`, `wspr-recorder`, `hfdl-recorder`, `codar-sounder`,
and `hf-timestd`.

Documentation layout:

- `README.md` — top-level summary + status + install.
- `docs/RECEIVER.md` — receiver methodology (network description,
  waveform parameters, DSP chain, output schema, open gaps).
- this file — developer / operator briefing.

## Status

**v0.1.0 — scaffolding.**  Full DSP pipeline structured but PRN code
generator is stubbed (deterministic ±1 sequence keyed on Tx ID, not
the real Hysell codes).  Awaiting two specs from the JRO team:

1. PRN generator polynomial + seed per (transmitter, frequency).
2. UTC code-epoch alignment rule (presumed: each 100 ms code period
   starts on a 100-ms-aligned UTC tick).

See `docs/RECEIVER.md` §6 for the full gap list.  Once supplied,
only `core/correlate.py:generate_prn_code()` needs to be replaced
to make the recorder lock to real over-the-air signals.

## Architecture

```
radiod (ka9q-radio, IQ preset)
  │  one channel per known Tx frequency (typically 2.72 + 3.64 MHz)
  │  ka9q-python ensure_channel(low_edge, high_edge) → ~100 kHz BW,
  │  100 kS/s decimated I/Q
  ▼
hf-gps-tec daemon (one per radiod, = one systemd instance)
  │
  ├─ FreqPipeline(2.72 MHz)
  │    ├─ ka9q.MultiStream subscription → 100 ms frames (10,000 samples)
  │    ├─ ReplicaBank: one PRN replica per known Tx, precomputed FFT
  │    ├─ correlate frame against every replica in parallel (FFT-based)
  │    ├─ stack 100 successive range profiles (10 s coherent integration)
  │    ├─ slow-time FFT → range-Doppler matrix per Tx
  │    ├─ 6 × 10-s power averaging (1 min incoherent integration)
  │    └─ first-hop detector → (pseudorange, Doppler, amplitude) per Tx
  ├─ FreqPipeline(3.64 MHz)
  ▼
Output (core/output.py)
  │   one JSONL record per (Tx, Rx, freq) per minute
  │   /var/lib/hf-gps-tec/<radiod_id>/YYYY/MM/DD.jsonl
  │   additive hf_gps_tec.spots row via sigmond.hamsci_sink.Writer

## Key design decisions

- **One systemd instance per radiod** (`hf-gps-tec@<radiod_id>.service`),
  matching the other recorders.
- **One ka9q-radio channel per Tx frequency.** Wideband I/Q at ≈100 kS/s,
  with `low_edge`/`high_edge` overrides on `ensure_channel` so the
  full ±50 kHz around each Tx frequency is captured (matches Hysell §2's
  100 kS/s decimated rate).
- **FFT-based circular cross-correlation** for the PRN correlator —
  10,000-chip code, 10,000-sample frame, single 10,000-point FFT pair
  per (Tx, freq) per 100 ms.  Replica FFTs precomputed once at startup.
- **Coherent integration over 10 s** (100 successive code reps) yields
  0.1 Hz Doppler resolution and 100× post-correlator gain.
- **Incoherent integration over 1 min** (6 × 10 s power averaging)
  matches Hysell §2's 1-minute cadence.
- **First-hop only** (matches Hysell 2018 + 2024) — first range bin
  exceeding the configured SNR threshold above noise floor.
- **JSONL canonical L1 artefact**, additive hamsci sink for cross-client
  aggregation; optional `.out.mod` legacy writer for direct JRO
  inversion pipeline consumption is a follow-up.
- **PRN spec is the only blocker.** Once the JRO team supplies the
  per-Tx generator polynomial + seed, the correlator can be made
  real with no other architectural change.

## Client contract (v0.7)

`src/hf_gps_tec/contract.py` declares
`CONTRACT_VERSION = "0.7"`.  Authoritative spec:
`/opt/git/sigmond/sigmond/docs/CLIENT-CONTRACT.md`.

Sections implemented in scaffolding:

- **§1 / §2 / §3 / §4 / §5** — native TOML config, radiod-id binding,
  self-describe CLI (`inventory`/`validate`/`version` `--json`),
  templated systemd unit, `deploy.toml` manifest.
- **§6 / §7** — uses ka9q-python `MultiStream`; data destination read
  from `ChannelInfo`, never client-specified.
- **§8** — `RADIOD_<id>_CHAIN_DELAY_NS` read from `coordination.env`.
- **§10 / §11** — `log_paths` in inventory output; daemon process log
  goes to systemd journal.  `HF_GPS_TEC_LOG_LEVEL` /
  `CLIENT_LOG_LEVEL` honored on startup.
- **§12** — validate hardening (config presence, station list sanity,
  PRN-stub warning surfaced explicitly).
- **§17** — hamsci sink writer (`hf_gps_tec.spots`) alongside canonical
  JSONL.

Deferred:

- **§14** — config init/edit wizard via `sigmond.wizard_dispatch`
  (operator hand-edits the TOML for now).
- **§18 (timing authority)** — capability boolean only;
  `timing_authority_applied = null` (RTP-default).  Once PRN sync is
  working, hf-timestd's authority snapshot is the natural way to
  anchor code epochs absolutely.
